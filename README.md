# P5.JS Server (Java)

## Description
This project is a simple http server written in vanilla Java, 
which serves a static html page with css styles and javascript.
The front-end also uses the 3rd party javascript library p5.JS for 
creating a drawing canvas and some customizable drawing settings.

The purpose of this project was to build a java server from scratch
without a framework and to use a 3rd party library for front-end in 
a Java project.
